Description: A utility to find machine-specific directories using Athena conventions
 The athdir utility is used to locate specific types of files in an
 Athena locker.  It knows about all the conventions for compatibility
 with older operating system versions and processor types, and is the
 preferred way to determine the correct directory in a locker in which
 to find binaries or other architecture-dependent files.
